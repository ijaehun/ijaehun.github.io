        "excerpt":"Default   This is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.   Left Align   This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it’s views. It’s favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.   Center Align   This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.   Right Align   This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it’s views. It’s prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it’s a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.   Justify Align   This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it’s place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude.  ","categories": ["Markup"],

Grab a paddle and let’s get started.      The image above happens to be centered.    The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned.   As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we’ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it’s thing. Mission accomplished!   And now for a massively large image. It also has no alignment.      The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.      And now we’re going to shift things to the right align. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there — Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don’t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don’t let anyone else tell you differently.   In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah — Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.   And just when you thought we were done, we’re going to do them all over again with captions!         Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.   The figure above happens to be centered. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.         Itty-bitty caption.

The figure element above has an inline style of width: 1200px set which should break it outside of the normal content flow.         Feels good to be right all the time.

You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.   To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.   Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:   def print_hi(name)   puts \"Hi, #{name}\" end print_hi('Tom') #=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.   Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk.

        "excerpt":"Jekyll themes distributed as Ruby gems are finally here to make installing and upgrading much easier. Gone are the days of forking a repo just to “install it”. Or dealing with merge conflicts when pulling in upstream commits to “upgrade it”.   If you’re interested in testing out Minimal Mistakes as a gemified theme read on. There are a few caveats though:      Support for a theme assets folder was recently added to Jekyll core, but has yet to be released or rolled into the github-pages gem. Meaning you can’t use Minimal Mistakes as a Ruby gem there just yet… locally served or self-hosted installs should be fine if you don’t mind using a pre-release version of Jekyll.   Windows users can’t currently use themes packaged as gems due to a bug with file paths in Jekyll core. This is being worked on so hopefully a fix is on the way soon.   Fine with all that? Great. Let’s continue.   If you’re migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven’t customized any of the _includes, _layouts, _sass partials, or assets this should be quick and painless.   Step 1: Remove Theme Files   Remove _includes, _layouts, _sass, assets folders and files within. You won’t need these anymore as they’re bundled in the theme.   If you customized any of these then leave them alone and only remove the untouched ones. If setup correctly your modified versions should act as overrides to the versions bundled with the theme.   Step 2: Update Gemfile   In order to test you’ll need to install pre-release gems of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes.   Start by replacing gem \"github-pages\" or gem \"jekyll\" with the following:   gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\"   Then add the pre-release Minimal Mistakes theme gem:   gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"`   When finished your Gemfile should look something like this:   source \"https://rubygems.org\"  gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\" gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"  group :jekyll_plugins do   # gem \"jekyll-archives\"   gem \"jekyll-paginate\"   gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"   gem \"jekyll-gist\"   gem \"jekyll-feed\" end   Step 3: Run Bundler   Run bundle install (or bundle update if you’re updating an existing repo) to install the pre-release gems.   Step 4: Install the Theme   Add theme: \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" to your _config.yml file.   If you’re migrating from an existing Minimal Mistakes site you shouldn’t have to change anything else after this. If it’s a new site consult then docs to properly config.   Please Note: Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, galleries, and feature rows have changed and now require a full path. Instead of just image: filename.jpg you’ll need to use the full path eg: image: assets/images/filename.jpg. The preferred location is now assets/images but can be placed elsewhere or external hosted. This applies for image references in _config.yml and author.yml.   Step 5: jekyll new Tweaks   If this is a new site be sure to add the following files to _data/ and customize as you see fit. There is currently no way of bundling them in with the theme, so be sure to consult the docs on how to properly use both.      _data/ui-text.yml - UI text documentation   _data/navigation.yml - navigation documentation   You’ll also need to:      Replace &lt;site root&gt;/index.html with a modified Minimal Mistakes index.html.   Change layout: post in _posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown to layout: single.   Remove about.md, or at the very least change layout: page to layout: single and remove references to icon-github.html (or copy to your _includes if using).     That’s it! If all goes well running bundle exec jekyll serve should spin-up your site. If you encounter any bumps please file an issue on GitHub and make sure to indicate you’re testing the pre-release Ruby gem version.   File an issue   Thanks!  ","categories": ["Jekyll"],
